NAME
    BSON - Pure Perl implementation of MonogoDB's BSON serialization

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use BSON qw/encode decode/;

        my $document = {
            _id    => BSON::ObjectId->new,
            date   => BSON::Time->new,
            name   => 'James Bond',
            age    => 45,
            amount => 24587.45,
            badass => BSON::Bool->true
        };

        my $bson = encode( $document );
        my $doc2 = decode( $bson );

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements BSON serialization and deserialization as
    described at <http://bsonspec.org>. BSON is the primary data
    representation for MongoDB.

EXPORT
    The module does not export anything. You have to request "encode" and/or
    "decode" maually.

        use BSON qw/encode decode/;

SUBROUTINES
  encode
    Takes a hashref and returns the serialized BSON string.

        my $bson = encode({ bar => 'foo' });

  decode
    Takes a BSON string and returns deserialized hashref.

        my $hash = decode( $bson );

    MongoDB, BSON::Time, BSON::ObjectId, BSON::Code, BSON::Binary,
    BSON::Bool, BSON::MinKey, BSON::MaxKey, BSON::Timestamp
